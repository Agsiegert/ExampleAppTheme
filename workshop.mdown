# ScrivitoJS Example App Workshop

## Preparation

### Goal 1: Have node ≥ 6 & npm ≥ 5 running

The command `node -v` should report at least `v6.0.0`. The command `npm -v` should report at least `5.0.0`.

#### How to achieve this

`npm` is part of the `node` installation. So installing `node` `8` or newer will also included `npm` `5`. Alternativly o	nly upgrade `npm`.

Option 1 - Using [🍺 Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```
brew install node

# or, if already node is already installed
brew upgrade node
```

Option 2 - Downloading installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Option 3 - Just upgrade `npm`:

```
npm install -g npm
```

### Goal 2: Local copy of example app

A local copy of the repository should exist on your machine.

#### How to achieve this

* `git clone git@github.com:infopark/scrivito_example_app_js.git`
* `cd scrivito_example_app_js/`

### Goal 3: Install all NPM packages

All npm packages needed for the example app should be installed.

#### How to achieve this
* `npm install` ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com) is the node package manager, similar to [bundler](https://bundler.io))

## Get a tenant

### Goal 4: Login/Register at my.scrivito.com

You should be able to log into [https://my.scrivito.com](https://my.scrivito.com).

#### How to achieve this

* Visit [https://my.scrivito.com](https://my.scrivito.com).
* Log in, if you already have an account.
* Register, if you not have an account yet.
	* If so, please use your official Infopark e-mail such as `first_name.last_name@infopark.de` (no `+xy` in the e-mail!). Otherwise you will not be recognized as an Infopark employee.
	* Click on the link, which is send via e-mail after the registration.

### Goal 5: have an empty "Infopark Play CMS" tenant

You should have a new (empty) "Infopark Play CMS" tenant to be used for this workshop.

#### How to achieve this

* Go to [https://my.scrivito.com/tenants](https://my.scrivito.com/tenants).
* Scroll down and click `CREATE AN INFOPARK PLAY CMS`.

### Goal 6: Configure the newly created tenant.

You should have a correctly configured tenant.

#### How to achieve this

* Go to [https://my.scrivito.com/tenants](https://my.scrivito.com/tenants).
* Look for `Firstname Lastname's Playground CMS` and click on it.
* In `OVERVIEW` click on edit and change the `TITLE`, e.g. to `ScrivitoJS Workshop`. Click save afterwards.
* In `USERS` click on `ADD MYSELF`.
* In `SETTINGS` scroll down to `DEVELOPMENT` and click edit.
	* Enter `http://localhost:8080` in `GENERAL CORS ORIGINS` and `MY ADDITIONAL CORS ORIGINS` for now. Click save afterwards.

### Goal 7: Local tenant ID + `npm start`

Your local copy of the example app should have a tenant ID. `npm start` should not throw an exception.

#### How to achieve this

* On the detail view of the configured tenant on `my.scrivito.com` go to `SETTINGS`.
* Scroll down to `SCRIVITO_TENANT`. Copy that ID.
* Now back to your terminal in folder `scrivito_example_app_js`:
	* Execute `echo SCRIVITO_TENANT=XY > .env`, so that the example app can read the tenant ID via [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).
	* Execute `npm start`.
  * This is how it looks like now: ![Sorry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86275/32378134-3e535d80-c0aa-11e7-853b-7345a7f94ef1.png)
  * We will fix this in the next step.

## Fill the tenant with content

Now you should have a running site on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) open in your browser with a "Something went wrong" message. So far everything is fine 😺.

### Goal 8: Create a working copy

You should have a working copy, that you can edit.

#### How to achieve this

* Visit [http://localhost:8080/scrivito/](http://localhost:8080/scrivito/).
* Click on `Edit` in the top area.
* Choose a name for the working copy, e.g. "Initial Content".

### Goal 9: Import the content

You should have the initial content imported.

#### How to achieve this

* Open your javascript console in your browser.
* Execute the following in the javascript console:
  ```
  scrivito_application.ExampleApp.DangerZone.importContent()
  ```
* Wait for "Saving..." in the top right corner to disappear. Since a lot of binaries such as images needs to be uploaded, this can take a minute or two.
* Reload the page.
* Publish the working copy.
* Enjoy the great content 😺.


If you now visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) you should see normal content.

## Deployment on Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is a CDN for single page apps, which makes deployment really easy. Think of it as Heroku for JavaScript.

### Goal 10: Login/Register on Netlify

You should have a netlify account.

#### How to achieve this
* Visit [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
* Click "Sign Up".
  * You can choose e-mail or GitHub. If you choose GitHub we can later on enable automatic deployments on push and preview deployments.

### Goal 11: Deploy first build

The world should see your version of the example app.

#### How to achieve this

* Execute `npm run build` to create a build of the example app. This can take a minute or two, since the js code is minified etc.
* Once the command is done, everything you need is in the `build/` folder.
* Now go to [https://app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com). In the "Drag a folder" section (at the bottom of the page) just drag and drop the newly created `build/` folder.
* Netlify will now create a new site and public URL for you. This can take some time.
* Copy the newly generated netlify URL. Also visit that URL.
* You should now be automatically redirected to `my.scrivito.com` with an error message such as `You try to access this CMS via origin "https://story-teller-lid-40740.netlify.com"`.
* Lets add this URL as a CORS URL:
	* On `my.scrivito.com` click on `CMS Instances` and select your Workshop tenant.
	* Under `SETTINGS` of your Workshop tenant add to the `GENERAL CORS ORIGINS` the newly created netlify URL, e.g. `http://localhost:8080 https://story-teller-lid-40740.netlify.com`. The `MY ADDITIONAL CORS ORIGINS` should still be `http://localhost:8080`.
* Now reload the newly create netlify URL again. Enjoy the great content 😺.

## Coding

Now let us start coding:

* Open `scrivito_example_app_js` in your favorite text editor.
* Some pointers:
  * [ES6](http://es6-features.org) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io)
  * [React](https://reactjs.org) and [JSX](http://buildwithreact.com/tutorial/jsx)
  * [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)

### Extend `DividerWidget` with custom image.

The current `DividerWidget` currently only has a hard coded image. Let's change that.

* Replace `src/Widgets/DividerWidget/DividerWidgetComponent.js` with:

  ```javascript
  Scrivito.provideComponent('DividerWidget', () =>
    <div className="hr-icon">
      <img src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/infopark.svg" />
    </div>
  );
  ```

* Now we want to be able to replace the image as an editor. Replace `src/Widgets/DividerWidget/DividerWidgetClass.js` with:

  ```javascript
  const DividerWidget = Scrivito.provideWidgetClass('DividerWidget', {
    attributes: {
      image: 'reference',
    },
  });

  export default DividerWidget;
  ```

* Replace `src/Widgets/DividerWidget/DividerWidgetComponent.js` with:

  ```javascript
  Scrivito.provideComponent('DividerWidget', ({ widget }) =>
    <div className="hr-icon">
      <Scrivito.ImageTag content={ widget } attribute="image" />
    </div>
  );
  ```

### Extend `VideoWidget` with Youtube.

The current `VideoWidget` can already play manually uploaded videos. We want to extend it, so that it can also play youtube videos.

#### How to achieve this

* In `src/Widgets/VideoWidget/VideoWidgetClass.js` add the following attribute:

  ```javascript
  youtubeVideoId: 'string',
  ```
* In `src/Widgets/VideoWidget/VideoWidgetEditingConfig.js` extend `properties` with `youtubeVideoId`.
* In `src/Widgets/VideoWidget/VideoWidgetComponent.js` add the following inside the `if (!videoUrl)` section:

  ```javascript
    const youtubeVideoId = widget.get('youtubeVideoId');
    if (youtubeVideoId) {
      return <div className="text-center">
        <iframe
          width="560"
          height="315"
          src={ `https://www.youtube.com/embed/${youtubeVideoId}` }
          frameBorder="0"
          gesture="media"
        />
      </div>;
    }
  ```

If you now create a video widget you can input a youtube video ID, such as `IvUU8joBb1Q` and see the video.

### Sessions

Now that we modified your first example app code, lets go further.

#### Option 1: Change main colors.

Adjust the `$brand-primary` and `$brand-secondary` in `index.scss` to fit your needs.

#### Option 2: Add Vimeo-Support to `VideoWidget`

Similar to youtube, the `VideoWidget` should also play [vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com) videos.

#### Option 3: Add a `AuthorComponent.js`.

Currently the author of a blogpost does not have a dedicated page. Change that.

#### Option 4: Full width for YouTube Videos in `VideoWidget`.

Youtube (and Vimeo) videos currently have a fixed width. It should automatically adjust to the available width of the surrounding `div`.

#### Option 5: Autocomplete icon for `IconWidget`.

Add a custom editing component to enable autocomplete for all [http://fontawesome.io/icons/](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) .

### Bonus Goal 1: Link Netlify to GitHub fork

Your github fork should be linked with the netlify tenant. This enables Continuous Deployment and

#### How to achieve this.

* On `app.netlify.com` go to `Deploy settings` and click `Link to repository`. Choose your fork of `scrivito_example_app_js`.
* Under `Build & deploy` and `Build environment variable` add `SCRIVITO_TENANT` with your tenant ID as the value.
* Now try `Trigger deploy" under "Deploys". This basically calls `npm run build` on Netlify servers and deploys the output of it.

#### How to achieve this

* On `my.scrivito.com` go to the `GENERAL CORS ORIGINS` part under `SETTINGS`. Now add a second URL to that. If your first URL is `https://mynetlifyprefix.netlify.com` than add `https://*-mynetlifyprefix.netlify.com` as a second URL.
